This resource can be used for all projects when we have filters in the query.
The filters can be on the following fields:
strategic_portfolio: Business area the project belongs to (string, e.g., "Market & Sell")
product_line: Product area (string, e.g., "PAS")
technology_project: Technology project flag (string, "YES" or "NO")

If a filter is used, you need to first call the tool - get_business_lines() which would show you the list of strategic_portfolios and product_lines.

Dynamic Project Filtering (PMO API)

You can now filter projects using any available project field and select which fields to return in the response.

API Endpoint: POST /projects/dynamic_filter

Request JSON schema:
{
  "fields": ["field1", "field2", ...],
  "filters": [
    {"column": "field_name", "operator": "=", "value": "..."},
    ...
  ],
  "logical_operator": "AND" // or "OR" (optional, defaults to "AND")
}

- "fields": List of columns to include in the response (besides constants).
- "filters": List of filter conditions. Each filter is a dict with "column", "operator", and "value".
- "logical_operator": How to combine filters ("AND" or "OR").

You may use any project field as a filter or returned field. See the project data schema for available fields.

Example:
{
  "fields": ["project_type", "start_date_est", "end_date_est"],
  "filters": [
    {"column": "strategic_portfolio", "operator": "=", "value": "Market & Sell"},
    {"column": "product_line", "operator": "=", "value": "NA Industry Performance"}
  ]
}
