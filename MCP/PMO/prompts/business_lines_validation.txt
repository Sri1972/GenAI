Business Lines Validation Workflow:

When user provides portfolio/product line names (possibly approximate):
1. Call get_business_lines() to get exact values
2. Match user input against both strategic_portfolio and product_line fields
3. Handle variations: lowercase, partial matches, common abbreviations
4. Return exact case-sensitive values for subsequent filtering
5. If no match found, suggest closest alternatives

Examples:
- 'vin solutions' → 'VIN Solutions' (product_line)
- 'market and sell' → 'Market & Sell' (strategic_portfolio)
- 'na industry' → 'NA Industry Performance' (product_line)
