Dynamic Project Filtering Workflow:

- For any query about project costs or hours, always include the following fields in the fields array:
  project_resource_hours_planned, project_resource_cost_planned, project_resource_hours_actual, project_resource_cost_actual.
- For summary queries, also include: project_name, strategic_portfolio, product_line, start_date_est, end_date_est.
- For queries asking for project details or similar, include all available fields in the fields array or just pass "all_columns" in the fields array of the get_filtered_projects tools. The full list of fields is in docs_filtered_projects.txt.
- Use the get_filtered_projects tool to filter projects using any available project field and select which fields to return.
- Provide a list of fields to include in the response.
- Provide a list of filters, each as a dict: {"column", "operator", "value"}.
- Optionally specify logical_operator ("AND" or "OR").
- If the user requests all fields or does not specify fields then if "fields" array = "all_columns".
- For list of fields look at the docs_filtered_projects.txt resources for the tool
- Example call:
  fields = ["project_type", "start_date_est", "end_date_est"]
  filters = [
    {"column": "strategic_portfolio", "operator": "=", "value": "Market & Sell"},
    {"column": "product_line", "operator": "=", "value": "NA Industry Performance"}
  ]
  logical_operator = "AND"
 - If the user query does not have the word cumulative in it, then do not return response field that have the word cumulative in it. Return all the other fields.
- See the project data schema for available fields.
