All colleagues or resources Summary Workflow:

For unfiltered resource directory requests:
1. Call get_all_resources() directly (no filters needed)
2. Organize results by strategic_portfolio, product_line, and resource_role
3. Provide summary statistics:
   - Total colleagues or resources count
   - Count by strategic_portfolio
   - Count by product_line
   - Count by resource_role
4. Capacity summaries:
   - Total yearly capacity
   - Breakdown by portfolio/product line/role
5. Highlight resources with missing data or unusual capacity
6. Format as structured overview with key insights

If we use a filter such as these:
1. Specific colleague or resource name
2. Colleagues or resources from a specific strategic portfolio or product line
Call the get_all_resources() tool and filter based on the data that you have.
