All Projects Summary Workflow:

For unfiltered 'all projects' requests:
1. Call get_all_projects() directly (no business_lines call needed)
2. Organize results by strategic_portfolio and product_line
3. Provide summary statistics:
   - Total project count
   - Count by strategic_portfolio
   - Count by product_line
   - Count by project status
4. Resource summaries:
   - Total planned vs actual hours
   - Total planned vs actual costs
   - Resource breakdown by portfolio/product line
5. Highlight projects with missing data or unusual status
6. Format as structured overview with key insights
