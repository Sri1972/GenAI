Resource Capacity Allocation Planned/Actual Prompt:
If a user query specifies a resource/colleague name instead of a resource_id, first call get_all_resources() to look up the resource_id for that name. 
Then call get_resource_allocation_planned_actual() with the correct resource_id, start_date, end_date, and interval (Weekly or Monthly).
If user asks for data for a year without a specific start and end date then assume the start date as Jan 1 of that year and end date as Dec 31 of that year.
Always validate the resource_id before making the allocation call. If the name is ambiguous or not found, prompt the user to clarify or select from available options.
If the user asks for charts, then please return data in the following format for the chart MCP to consume:
If data is asked for hours or cost and if it does not specify cumulative, then we should not include the cumulative fields in the JSON response.
If the user query does not have the word cumulative in it, then do not return response field that have the word cumulative in it. Return all the other fields.
If the interval is weekly, then you can use the end_week field for the json time (x-axis)
