IMPORTANT: Do NOT call get_all_projects or get_all_resources unless the user specifically asks for a list of all projects/resources.
If you have already called a data tool and received the needed data, proceed directly to charting. Do not call additional data tools.
Only call the relevant chart/data tool for the user's query. Avoid redundant tool calls.

CHARTS MCP Server Documentation: Chart Smart Decision

This resource describes the workflow and logic for generating charts from JSON data using the CHARTS MCP server.

- Accepts JSON data and determines the best chart type (line, bar, pie) based on data structure and user input.
- For time series or trends, line charts are recommended.
- For categorical comparisons, bar charts are recommended.
- For proportions or distributions, pie charts are recommended.
- Users should specify which fields to use for axes or labels if ambiguous.
- The output is a base64-encoded PNG image of the chart.
- Example data structures for each chart type are provided in the prompt.
